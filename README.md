# `thetayloredman / archive`

## What is this?

I had my personal site running on GitHub pages for a while, so I ended up trashing it.

I was very upset in myself for doing it, but I eventually started a new project for it. [`thetayloredman / copypasta`](https://github.com/thetayloredman/copypasta/) [with a visible site here](https://thetayloredman.github.io/). But then, I **discovered that the local copy of the site wasn't deleted**. I compressed it into a `.zip` file, and now I've decompressed it here. This is also running as a GitHub pages site, and available [here](https://thetayloredman.github.io/archive/)

## Will it be updated?

I'm trying my best **not** to update this site, so it stays as the original.

## Where's the zip archive?

You can probably see it! It's `/thetayloredman.github.io.zip`.
